# Streamlit App MVP - Deployment Ready

## âœ… Integration Complete

The Streamlit app has been successfully integrated with the peer discovery system and is now ready for cloud deployment.

## ðŸ”§ Changes Made

### 1. **Peer Discovery Integration**
- Added import for `peer_discovery.py` system
- Integrated `PeerDiscoveryService`, `NodeType`, and `PeerInfo` classes
- Added peer discovery initialization in main app flow

### 2. **Real Network Data**
- Replaced `get_mock_storage_info()` with `get_real_storage_info()`
- Replaced `get_mock_files()` with `get_real_files()`
- Added `get_network_stats()` function for real network metrics
- Added `get_available_workers()` function for worker discovery

### 3. **Dashboard Enhancements**
- Network health status showing real peer count
- Active worker nodes from discovered peers
- Real-time connection status
- Network statistics from peer discovery

### 4. **Chat Interface Improvements**
- Shows connected worker nodes count
- Lists network-available models from discovered workers
- Enhanced model selection with network models

### 5. **Settings Page**
- Added Network Status section
- Shows Node ID, discovered peers, and uptime
- Lists discovered peers with their types
- Real-time network health monitoring

### 6. **Code Cleanup**
- Removed debug prints
- Updated function names for consistency
- Added proper error handling
- Cleaned up configuration loading
