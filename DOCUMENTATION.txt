1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

1.1 WHAT IS AI COMPUTE NETWORK?
-------------------------------
AI Compute Network is a fully decentralized peer-to-peer system that allows 
users to share their computing resources (CPU, GPU, RAM, Storage) to create 
a distributed AI inference network. Unlike centralized cloud services, this 
network is owned and operated by its users.

Key Features:
- Decentralized architecture (no central servers)
- Resource contribution with configurable percentages
- Real-time resource adjustment while running
- Mobile-first design with Progressive Web App
- Blockchain-based task coordination and rewards
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux, mobile)

1.2 WHY DECENTRALIZED AI COMPUTE?
---------------------------------
Traditional Problems:
- Expensive cloud AI services ($0.10-$2.00 per 1000 tokens)
- Vendor lock-in with major cloud providers
- Centralized control and potential censorship
- Limited access in certain regions
- High barriers to entry for AI developers

Our Solution:
- Community-owned infrastructure (free to join)
- No single point of failure or control
- Global accessibility via P2P networks
- Low-cost AI inference for everyone
- Democratic governance and open source

1.3 NETWORK ECONOMICS
---------------------
Participants earn tokens by:
- Running bootstrap nodes (network infrastructure)
- Contributing compute resources (CPU/GPU/RAM)
- Providing storage for AI models and data
- Mobile participation (signing and validation)

Token utility:
- Pay for AI inference tasks
- Governance voting rights
- Network fee distribution
- Staking for enhanced rewards

================================================================================

The AI Compute Network represents a paradigm shift from centralized cloud 
computing to decentralized, community-owned infrastructure. By enabling users 
to share their computing resources and earn tokens for their contributions, 
the network creates a sustainable and equitable ecosystem for AI development 
and deployment.

Key innovations include:
- True decentralization with no central authority
- Dynamic resource allocation with real-time adjustment
- Mobile-first design with Progressive Web App technology
- Blockchain-based coordination and payment systems
- Community governance and democratic decision-making

The network's success depends on community participation, technical excellence, 
and continuous innovation. As the ecosystem grows, it will enable new forms of 
AI applications and services that were previously impossible or economically 
unfeasible.
