üåê **IPFS Network Distribution**:

1. **Content Addressing**: Files are identified by their content hash (CID)
   - Same content = same CID across all nodes
   - Changes to content = new CID

2. **Distributed Storage**: 
   - Files are stored across multiple IPFS nodes
   - No single point of failure
   - Redundancy through replication

3. **Network Discovery**:
   - Nodes announce what content they have
   - DHT (Distributed Hash Table) helps locate content
   - Peer discovery finds nodes with requested files

4. **Retrieval Process**:
   - Request file by CID from any IPFS gateway
   - Gateway locates nodes that have the content
   - File is retrieved and served to requester
   - Popular files may be cached on multiple gateways

5. **Our Network Integration**:
   - Bootstrap node runs IPFS daemon
   - Files uploaded through bootstrap node
   - Content becomes available network-wide
   - Other nodes can pin/cache popular content

‚ö° **Key Benefits**:
‚úÖ Decentralized - no central server
‚úÖ Content-addressable - tamper-proof
‚úÖ Efficient - deduplication and caching
‚úÖ Resilient - multiple copies across network
‚úÖ Global - accessible from any IPFS gateway
