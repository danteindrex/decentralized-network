## 🚀 Worker Node Capabilities

1. **Event Listening**: Monitors blockchain for InferenceRequested events
2. **Model Management**: Loads/unloads models as needed
3. **MCP Enhancement**: Supports tool-augmented inference
4. **Response Handling**: Uploads results to IPFS and submits to blockchain
5. **Resource Monitoring**: Tracks system resources and prevents overload

## 📋 Ready for Production

The worker node is ready to:
- ✅ Listen for inference jobs from the blockchain
- ✅ Process prompts with MCP-enhanced capabilities
- ✅ Submit responses back to the smart contract
- ✅ Handle multiple job types and models
- ✅ Manage system resources effectively

## 🎯 Next Steps

The system is operational and ready for:
1. Production deployment
2. Job submission testing
3. Multi-worker scaling
4. Performance optimization
