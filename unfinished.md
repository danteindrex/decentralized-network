# Unfinished Tasks

This document lists the tasks that are currently incomplete or require further attention.

## 1. AI Integration (Inference)
- The AI integration functionality (running inference) is not fully operational.
- We have added logging to `network-service.js` to diagnose issues with `submitInferenceJob` and `monitorJobCompletion`. Further debugging is required to identify and fix the root cause.

## 2. File Uploading (Advanced Features)
- Basic file uploading to IPFS is implemented in the Electron application.
- The original request mentioned "file chunking still is integrated," implying a more advanced chunking mechanism. This feature was deferred and is not yet implemented.

## 3. Android APK Compilation
- The Android APK compilation is currently failing due to persistent Android SDK path issues.
- Despite attempts to configure `sdk.dir` in `local.properties` and setting `ANDROID_HOME`, the build process cannot locate the SDK. Further investigation into the Android SDK setup on the host machine is needed.
